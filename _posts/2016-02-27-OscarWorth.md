Winning an Oscar, or any film award for that matter, can drastically increase the earning potential of an actor or actress. But how much the award matters depends on how much they are already making. Here are the 2016 Oscar Nominees for best lead and supporting roles, sorted by their net worth. An interesting note about this year's award for Best Leading Actress.
