I live in Melbourne, Australia, where I am a post-doctoral researcher studying functional genomics at the single cell level in [Davis McCarthy's](https://www.svi.edu.au/research_themes/bioinformatics_and_cellular_genomics/) lab. I completed my PhD in Plant Biology at Michigan State University in 2019. My dissertation ([available here](https://d.lib.msu.edu/etd/48232)) was on training and interpreting machine learning models for genomic prediction (a.k.a. predicting traits like yield and flowering time from genetic information) and for improving our understanding of the cis-regulatory code regulating how plants respond to combined heat and drought stress at the gene expression level. My undergraduate degree is in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry with a minor in Environmental Science from Middlebury College.
