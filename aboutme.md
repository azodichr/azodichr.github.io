I live in Melbourne, Australia, where I am a post-doctoral researcher studying functional genomics at the single cell level in the [Davis McCarthy](https://www.svi.edu.au/research_themes/bioinformatics_and_cellular_genomics/) lab. I enjoy working at the interface of different fields. My PhD research touched on plant genetics, data science, predictive biology, gene regulation, genomics, and even a bit of social science. My undergraduate degree is in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from Middlebury College.
